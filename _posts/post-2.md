title: Consistent Branding and Identity
---

Building a strong, recognizable brand image is foundational for cultivating trust and recognition among our target audience.

The 48.9% visibility result for the Hnry website highlights the pivotal role of keyword optimization to maximise the brand's exposure.

Backlink analysis exposes a significant dependency on government domains, signaling a need to expand and diversify our referral sources to ensure sustained growth.

With brand name visibility currently at a modest 20%, it's imperative that we prioritise consistent imagery and branding efforts to solidify Hnry's presence and resonate effectively within the market.
